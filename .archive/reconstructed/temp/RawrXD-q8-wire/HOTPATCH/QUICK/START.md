## What Gets Tested

| Layer | What | Real Metrics |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **1. Memory** | Live weight scaling, attention tuning, layer bypass | Baseline vs Patched TPS, stability % |
| **2. Byte** | File modifications, metadata patching | Bytes modified, hash changes, load verification |
| **3. Server** | System prompt injection, temperature override, caching | TPS impact, latency overhead |
| **4. Coordinated** | All layers together for optimization | Total throughput improvement % |

**9 Real Models:** BigDaddyG variants, Codestral  
**Total Scenarios:** 36+ real test cases  
**All Real:** No simulations, all actual GPU inference

## What Happens During Test

```
Start
  ↓
Discover 9 GGUF models in d:\OllamaModels\
  ↓
For each model:
  1. Memory Layer: Test weight scaling, attention scaling, layer bypass
     - Baseline inference → get TPS
     - Apply patch → get TPS
     - Compare performance (delta %)
     - Validate stability (3 runs)
  
  2. Byte Layer: Test file modifications
     - Copy model file
     - Modify bytes
     - Verify file integrity
     - Test can still load and run
  
  3. Server Layer: Test protocol transforms
     - Baseline inference
     - Apply server patches (prompt, temperature, cache)
     - Compare performance impact
  
  4. Coordinated: Test all layers together
     - Stack memory + server patches
     - Measure cumulative improvement
     - Validate stability of combined patches

## Common Issues & Fixes

| Issue | Fix |
|:---|:---|
| "Command not found" | Make sure you're in `d:\temp\RawrXD-q8-wire\` |
| GPU out of memory | Use `-Quick` flag or reduce models tested |
| Benchmark exe not found | Build first: `cmake --build build --target gpu_inference_benchmark` |
| Timeout | Models too large for GPU RAM, use smaller models first |

---

## After Test Completes

1. **Review Results**
   ```powershell
   # Open HTML report in browser
   Start-Process "hotpatch_test_results\HOTPATCH_REPORT_*.html"
   ```

2. **Commit to GitHub**
   ```powershell
   cd d:\temp\RawrXD-q8-wire
   git add hotpatch_test_results/
